# Horiseon Project

## Description

The purpose for this project is to refactor the code for the Horiseon website. The refactoring is needed to make the code more accessible and improve organization using semantic elements.The refactor does not change the look or function of the website.

### Improvements Made
* Added a clear and concise title.
* Changed HTML div elements to semantic elements (header, nav, section, article,aside, and footer) to help distinguish each section.
* Added comments on index.html to further distinguish each section.
* Added id for the first article in the main content section to get the nav link to work.
* Added alt attributes on all images to assist with screen readers.
* Changed the h2 element to an h4 element in the footer to follow the correct order.
* Updated the style.css file to include the semantic tags.
* Consolidated recurring code on the style.css file.
* Organized the style.css file to follow the semantic structure.
